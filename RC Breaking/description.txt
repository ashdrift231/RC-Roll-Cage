The code is an Arduino program that uses pulse width modulation (PWM) to control the speed and direction of two motors. 
The code uses an obstacle sensor to check the presence of an obstacle and stops the motors if an obstacle is detected. 
The code also defines a function named "breaking" to control the motors.

The program starts by initializing the serial monitor and setting the mode of pin 13 to OUTPUT. 
The pulseToPWM function takes an input pulse and converts it to a motor PWM signal, 
with a deadzone defined so that anything within the deadzone will stop the motor.

The "breaking" function takes an input signal and checks its value against the deadzone. 
If the signal is less than the negative of the deadzone, the right motor is enabled and given a high signal, 
and then the right PWM pin is set to a high value for two seconds, before the right 
and left enable pins are set to low to halt the motors.

Similarly, if the signal is greater than the deadzone, the left motor is enabled and given a high signal,
 and then the left PWM pin is set to a high value for two seconds, before the right 
and left enable pins are set to low to halt the motors.

Finally, the loop function continuously reads the signal from the CH_2_PIN, converts it to a PWM signal using pulseToPWM, 
and then passes it to the breaking function to control the motors.
