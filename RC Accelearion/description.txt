This code sets up an Arduino sketch to control a motor driver using an RC receiver.

The controller pins and motor driver pins are declared as constants. 
The deadzone is defined as 20. This means that anything between -20 and 20 will be considered a stop.

In the setup function, the pins are configured as inputs or outputs using pinMode. 
The STBY_PIN is commented out and not used in this code.

The drive function takes two parameters, speed_a and speed_b, 
and sets the direction of the motor and its speed.
Speed_a and speed_b are limited to between -255 and 255.

The pulseToPWM function takes a pulse value and converts it to a PWM value between -255 and 255. 
If the pulse value is within the deadzone, the motor is stopped.

In the loop function, the pulse width from the RC receiver is read and converted 
to a PWM value using pulseToPWM. 
The drive function is then called with the converted value to control the motor. 
A delay of 5 milliseconds is added at the end to prevent the program from taking too much processing power.
