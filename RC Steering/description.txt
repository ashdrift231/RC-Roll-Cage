This is an Arduino code that implements a PID control loop to control the speed of a motor based on input from a potentiometer 
and pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. The code includes the PID library which can be found at the URL: http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary

The PID control loop is set up with the variables Pk1, Ik1, Dk1, Setpoint1, Input1, Output1, and Output1a 
representing the proportional, integral, and derivative gains, setpoint, input, output, and absolute output value, respectively.

The setup() function sets the digital pins 2 and A0 as inputs and pins 5 and 6 as outputs. 
It also attaches an interrupt handler for the pin 2, which measures the pulse width of the PWM signal, 
and sets up the serial communication at 115200 baud. The PID1 object is created with the input and setpoint variables, 
the gains, and the sample time. The PID1 object is set to run in automatic mode and with output limits of -255 to 255.

The timeit() function is the interrupt handler that measures the pulse width of the PWM signal. 
It calculates the pulse width by measuring the elapsed time between the rising and falling edges of the signal.

The loop() function implements a timer to control the frequency of updates. Every 20 milliseconds, 
the potentiometer value is read, and the pulse width is mapped to a value between -255 and 255 and assigned to the setpoint variable. 
The Compute() method of the PID1 object is called to update the output value, and the motor is driven based on the output value. 
If the output value is positive, the motor is driven in one direction, and if it is negative, the motor is driven in the other direction. 
The output and input values are printed to the serial monitor for debugging purposes.
