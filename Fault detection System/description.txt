The code is an Arduino sketch that uses an ACS712 current sensor to detect current levels and control LEDs.
It first defines the pins that the current sensors are connected to and stores the pin numbers for the LEDs in an array. 
There are two threshold levels for the current sensors defined, which are used to trigger the LEDs.

In the setup function, the serial monitor is initialized and the LED pins are set as outputs. 
The loop function starts by reading the current levels of the 5 sensors and storing them in an array. 
The current levels are then compared with the threshold levels to determine which LED should be turned on. 
If a sensor's current level is below the threshold, the corresponding LED is turned on for half a second, 
and then turned off for half a second.

A switch statement is used to control the LEDs based on which current sensor triggered the LED. 
If the first sensor's current level is below the threshold, the first LED is turned on, 
and all other LEDs are turned off. The same logic applies to the second, third and fourth sensor.
 The current level of the triggered sensor is also printed in the serial monitor.
