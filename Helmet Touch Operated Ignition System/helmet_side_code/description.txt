In this sketch, we include the necessary libraries for the nrf24l01 transceiver and the capacitive touch sensor. 

The touch sensor pin is defined as TOUCH_SENSOR_PIN and set as an input. 

The setup function initializes the serial communication, sets the touch sensor as an input, 
and sets up the nrf24l01 transceiver with the channel and payload size. 

The loop function checks if the touch sensor is pressed, and if it is, 
sends the message "Touch" via the nrf24l01 transceiver and waits for a moment to prevent multiple messages.
