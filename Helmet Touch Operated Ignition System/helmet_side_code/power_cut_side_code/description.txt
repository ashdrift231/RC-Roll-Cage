The code is an Arduino sketch that monitors the incoming data via the NRF24L01 transceiver. 
The transceiver is used to receive messages and the sketch checks the incoming messages 
to see if they match the string "Touch detected". If the incoming message matches the expected string, 
the relay module is disconnected.

The code starts with the required libraries being imported, 
including the libraries for the NRF24L01 transceiver and the SPI communication protocol.

In the setup() function, the pins for the transceiver and the relay module are defined
and the communication between the transceiver and the Arduino is initialized. 
The setup also includes the configuration for the transceiver, 
such as setting its address, channel and payload size.

In the loop() function, the code continually checks for incoming messages and compares the received message 
to the expected string "Touch detected". If the received message matches the expected string,
 the relay module is disconnected using the digitalWrite function.

Overall, the code provides a simple solution for monitoring incoming messages via the NRF24L01 transceiver
and disconnecting the relay module based on the message received.
