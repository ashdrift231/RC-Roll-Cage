This code is a simple sketch for controlling various sensors and actuators on an Arduino board. 
It uses the following libraries: Wire.h, Adafruit_Sensor.h, Adafruit_TSL2561_U.h, and Adafruit_BME280.h. 
It initializes an BME280 temperature sensor to measure temperature and sets up communication with the Arduino's serial port. 
The code defines several constants that represent the pin connections of different sensors (e.g. temperature, smoke, proximity) 
and actuators (e.g. LED, fan, relay) on the board.

The setup function sets the initial state of the pins and starts serial communication with the computer. 
The loop function continuously reads data from the various sensors, converts the temperature data to Celsius, 
and updates the state of the LEDs and actuators based on the sensor readings. For example, if the temperature exceeds a threshold value, 
the tempLed and relay are turned on, while if the smoke sensor reading is high, the smokeLed and fan are turned on. 
The code then waits for 1 second before reading the sensors again.
